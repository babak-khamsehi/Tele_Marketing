# TeleMarketing_Success
Succes of telemarketing for a bank in Python and Sklearn
Project: Predicting the success of bank telemarketing using Python and Scikit-learn; with the objective of comparing multiple classifiers based on different evaluation metrics using Python
-	Data preparation: Obtained the data from UCI ML repository with 20 features and 41,188 instances. Explored the data using scatter plot visualization (for continuous features) and cross-tabs (for class variables) and performed dummy coding for class variables.
-	Split the data into training and test datasets; for the training datasets, computed and visualized the feature importance’s based on decision tree classifier, visualizing the training set via a scatter plot of the most important features.
-	Models: Dummy classifiers (base line), logistic regression, support vector machine (both gaussian, and linear), and decision trees. 
-	Model Evaluation and performance: compared different classifiers using confusing matrix, classification report (precision, recall, F1 score, support) and Fβ (β= 0.5) and ROC curves with different hyper parameters. 
-	Model tuning: Performed model tuning using GridSearch for every classifier.
